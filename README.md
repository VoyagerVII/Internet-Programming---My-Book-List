# Internet Programming Project

## Description
With this project we plan to give users a quick, and simple way to create, access and manage their book lists on the web. This will help us gain users by providing a free service with minimal ads, that doesn't push users to buy products. Having an advertisement free interface cements My-Book-List as a cleaner more user friendly alternative to our competitors driving users to us.
